\section baseSEC Base Hierarchy

Most toolkits and frameworks provide a common base class from which all classes
are derived that can use features of the toolkit or framework. In the cgv framework
this class is simply called "base" and lives in the namespace cgv::base. The 
\ref cgv::base::base "base" class provides support for
- reference counting of instances
- type casts
- self reflection of the members and methods and access to properties
- registration by a plugin.

\a Careful: Although multiple inheritance is used heavily in the cgv framework, it is not allowed
to inherit \ref cgv::base::base "base" more than one time, what would lead to \b object \b schizophrenia. C++ does not
allow to enforce this constraint, which therefore lies in the responsibility
of the programmer. Please be aware of that!

Besides the \ref cgv::base::base "base" class, the following derived classes extend its functionality:
- \ref cgv::base::named "named" ... support for a name stored for each instance
- \ref cgv::base::node "node" ... extends the \ref cgv::base::named "named" by a pointer to a parent instance
- \ref cgv::base::group "group" ... extends \ref cgv::base::node "node" by methods that allow to organize a list of child instances

Theses classes already provide the functionality to construct doubly linked
tree structures and singly linked acyclic graph structures.

The \ref cgv::base::base "base" class has two more methods that can be used by derived classes
in an arbitrary way:
- \ref cgv::base::base::update() "update()" ... for example used by gui classes to post a redraw
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_user_data() "get_user_data()" ... for example by a gui implementation with a 
  specific toolkit, returns the toolkit specific gui element instance

\subsection baseRC Reference Counting of Instances

Dynamic memory management with malloc/free and new/delete is quite error prone in C and C++. Frequently memory leaks
are caused by instances that are allocated but never deallocated again. To circumvent this problem smart
pointers have been proposed that implement the concept of reference counting. Here a counter is attached 
to each allocated instance, which counts the number of pointers that reference the instance. The counter is
incremented when a new pointer references the instance and decremented if the reference is removed. As soon as
the counter is decreased to zero the instance is removed as it cannot be referenced anymore. Smart pointers
are implemented in C++ as template classes that overload (re)implement the constructors, destructor and assignment 
operator such that reference counting is done automatically.

There are two choices of where to store the reference counter. Either directly as member of the instance or in an
additionally allocated memory block. The first approach is faster and more memory efficent, but has the prerequisite 
that each instance provides a reference counter and that the access to the reference counter is provided to the smart
pointer. In the cgv framework both reference counting approaches are supported. The first and more efficient one can
be used by deriving a class from cgv::data::ref_counted, which simply adds a reference counter to the members of the
class. The smart pointers for both approaches are implemented in the cgv::data::ref_ptr template, which takes the instance
type as first template argument and a boolean parameter as second argument. The boolean parameter tells, whether the
instance type is derived from cgv::data::ref_counted or not.

The \ref cgv::base::base "base" class is also derived from cgv::data::ref_counted such that reference counting is the
default approach for instances derived from \ref cgv::base::base "base". Therefore all headers corresponding to the types
in the base hierarchy contain a declaration of the corresponding smart pointer type, i.e. \ref cgv::base::base_ptr "base_ptr",
\ref cgv::base::node_ptr "node_ptr", etc. Please \b always use these types to declare pointers to instances of types from the 
base hierarchy.

\subsection baseTC Type Casts

In C++ there is a very important type cast denoted \c dynamic_cast which attempts to cast an instance of type A to type B. 
If the instance is not derived from B, the dynamic type cast returns a null pointer. The common usage of the dynamic type
cast operator is to perform casts to derived classes or to check whether an instance implements a given interface. In the 
cgv framework a lot of functionality works on \ref cgv::base::base_ptr "base_ptr"s. For traversal of the tree / graph structures
one often needs to know whether a base instance is actually a \ref cgv::base::node "node" or even \ref cgv::base::group "group"
and has a parent or even children. Furthermore, the gui driver needs to know from an instance whether it provides a GUI or not.
This is done deriving a class from for example \ref cgv::base::node "node" and from the interface class cgv::gui::provider. The 
GUI driver can then use the dynamic type cast to cgv::gui::provider to check whether an instance provides a GUI.

The \ref cgv::base::base "base" class provides special methods to simplify the dynamic type casts:
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_named() "get_named()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to \ref cgv::base::named_ptr "named_ptr"
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_node() "get_node()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to \ref cgv::base::node_ptr "node_ptr"
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_group() "get_group()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to \ref cgv::base::group_ptr "group_ptr"
- \ref cgv::base::base::cast() "cast<T>()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to type cgv::data::ref_ptr<T>
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_interface() "get_interface<T>()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to interface type \c T*, note that 
  reference counting cannot be supported anymore as interface types are not derived from \ref cgv::base::base "base".
- \ref cgv::base::base::get_const_interface() "get_const_interface<T>()" ... use dynamic type cast to cast to interface type \c const \c T*, note that 
  reference counting cannot be supported anymore as interface types are not derived from \ref cgv::base::base "base".

\subsection propInt Property Interface
In addition to the self reflection functionality a more general property interface is provided by the \ref cgv::base::base "base" class.
Properties can simply be class members or more complex configurations that influence more than one class member. Properties are 
accessed by their names and have only the basic types \c bool, \c int (8, 16, 32 or 64 bit), \c float (32 or 64 bit) or \c string. 
Automatic conversion rules between these types are provided such that each property can be queried in each of the available types.

The following methods can be used to access properties:
- \ref cgv::base::base::get() "get<T>()"... return a property in the type specified as template argument
- \ref cgv::base::base::set() "set()"... set the property from a value whose type is automatically derived from the template parameter
- \ref cgv::base::base::is_property() "is_property()"... check if property of given name exists
- \ref cgv::base::base::multi_set() "multi_set()"... set several properties from through a string of the form
  "name1=value1;name2=value2;..."

The programmer has to overload the following methods in derived classes
to provide access to properties:
- base::get_property_declarations() ... return a string containing a semicolon 
  separated list of property declarations. 
- base::get_void() ... retrieve a property value and store it in a value pointed to by the passed void pointer
- base::set_void() ... set a property from a value pointed to by the passed void pointer

The class cgv::type::variant can be used to access the arguments which are passed as arbitrary types. 
The default implementation of the property interface uses the 
method \ref cgv::base::base::self_reflect() "self_reflect()" to declare, get and set properties.
Example implementations are found in the examples plugin for example in the header 
plugins/examples/simple_cube_8.h.

\subsection baseRG Registration by a Plugin

Instances of the classes derived from \ref cgv::base::base "base" can be published to the application and to previously 
registered listeners by plugins through the registration facility describe in section \ref Plugins. The following
two methods allow an instance to react to registration and unregistration:
- \ref cgv::base::base::register() "register()" ... called by registration facility after instance has been registered at all listeners.
- \ref cgv::base::base::unregister() "unregister()" ... called by registration facility after instance has been unregistered completely

\section Plugins Registration Mechanism for Plugins

Plugins are compiled code modules that can be loaded at runtime. They are
realized in C++ via shared libraries / dlls. Plugins typically contain 
implementations of interface classes defined in the cgv library such as
specializations of image readers. Furthermore, plugins can contain resource
files such as icons and images.

The most important task of a plugin is to tell the application by whom it is 
loaded, which that loads the plugin.


Plugins in cgv use the registration functionality implemented
in cgv/base/register.h and cgv/base/register.cxx to provide
 - instances of implemented class, 
 - factories for instances
 - test functions
 - registration listeners, 
 - drivers (for example for the gui), 
 - servers (for example for fonts or triggers) and 
 - resource files such as image files, which are embedded into an
   executable of an application or into a plugin. 
 - resource files can be embedded in binary format into an application or plugin 
   by converting it with the \c res_prep tool to a cxx-file that can be compiled. 
   This performs an automatic registration of the resource file, which can be accessed 
   through the functions defined in the header cgv/data/import.h (see function 
   cgv::base::register_resource_file). For resource files with the extensions
   "*.bmp;*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.png;*.tif;*.tiff" (defined in the file make/vs/cgv_rules.rules)
   the files only need to be present in the source directory and the makefile generation facility
   does the rest.

Except of resource files all other registration entity must be of a class type that 
inherits cgv::base::base exactly once. Specialized registration entities are marked
as such by deriving them also from one of the classes (all declared in cgv/base/register.h):
 - cgv::base::test, 
 - cgv::base::factory, 
 - cgv::base::registration_listener,
 - cgv::base::driver, 
 - cgv::base::server

Registration can be done for example in the \c main function of an application
with the function cgv::base::register_object(object_ptr, options) taking two
parameters - the to be registered object and an option string. The option string
is used to steer where the object should be registered to and to allow specification
of arbitrary registration parameters. For example when registering a factory, one can
specify a menu text and a shortcut that are used by the standard viewer to integrate
the factory into the menu structure.

When calling the cgv::base::register_object function, the object and option string are
passed to all previously registered registration listeners with the method 
cgv::base::registration_listener::register_object(object,option). After registration the
cgv::base::base::on_register() method of the registered object is called. This gives the
object the opportunity to initialize itself knowing that it has been integrated into the
gui and rendering structures.

As the programmer cannot know which registration listeners keep reference counted pointers
to a registered object, the function cgv::base::unregister_object is provided. Again all
registered listeners are notified by their unregister_object method and afterwards the 
unregister() method of the object itself is called. The listeners must make sure to remove
all reference counted pointers onto the object passed to their unregister_object() method.
The object itself would unregister all objects created by itself in its unregister() method.
Typically, unregistration of an object will cause it and all its dependent objects to be 
destroyed.

The dynamic version of the cgv_viewer allows to load plugins in form of 
shared libraries / dlls based on parsing the command line arguments or configuation
files. The viewer uses the function cgv::base::process_command_line_args to process
all commands specified on the command line and recursively in configuration files.
As the \c main functions in shared libraries / dlls are not standardized, the register_object()
function cannot be used in plugins to for registration. Instead one declares static instances
of helper classes whose constructors are called when loading the shared library. The 
registration is then performed in the constructor of the helper class. The following
helper classes are provided in cgv/base/register.h:
 - cgv::base::object_registration<T> ... registers an instance created with the default 
   constructor. The constructor of the helper class also allows to specify an options string,
 - cgv::base::object_registration_1<T,CA> ... same as above but uses a constructor with one
   argument of type CA,
 - cgv::base::object_registration_2<T,CA> ... same as above but uses a constructor with two
   arguments of type CA1 and CA2,
 - cgv::base::factory_registration<T> ... registers a default implementation of a factory class
   that allows to create new instances during runtime. The constructor of the helper class
   has additional parameters for the type name of the created instances, whether the factory
   can generate only one instances at a time and the options for factory as well as created
   instance registration.
 - cgv::base::factory_registration_1<T,CA> ... see above
 - cgv::base::factory_registration_2<T,CA1,CA2> ... see above
 - cgv::base::resource_file_registration ... registeres a resource file, what is typically
   only used in source files automatically generated with the res_prep tool for resource
   files
 
During loading a shared library the registration is automatically disabled with the
function cgv::base::disable_registration(). This is important as the construction of
instances that demand for the loading of another shared library can cause a deadlock
of the application. Instead in the disabled registration all registration events are
cached and executed after loading of the shared library has been completed. The the
cgv::base::enable_registration() function is called again and the objects are registered
in the order server, driver, listerener and all the rest. Resource file registration on the
other hand is unproblematic and not delayed. One can turn off the discarding of the 
registration events with the function cgv::base::disable_registration_event_cleanup().
This gives listeners of plugins that are read later access to previously registered
objects and is the default in the standard cgv_viewer application.

Finally, one can turn on permanent registration by the function 
cgv::base::enable_permanent_registration() in order to keep a list of all registered
objects. This list gives configuration files access to all registered objects and allows
to set their members at program start. Also this option is enabled in the standard cgv_viewer
application.

\subsection RegEx Registration Example
Suppose you have implemented a class \c picker in your plugin and want to
register a new instance of type \c picker when your plugin is loaded. Then
you simply add the following line to the cxx file where you implemented
the \c picker class:
\code
#include <cgv/base/register.h>
cgv::base::object_registration<picker> picker_registration("");
\endcode
The argument to the \c picker_registration constructor is the option string passed to
the register_object function and can be used to select a specific 
listener. For example if you have several windows that can integrate the gui
of registered objects, you can select the parent window for your object by
specifying the name of the parent window in then argument to the object registration
contructor. If an empty string is specified, all listeners will register the object.

If you want to register a factory that can generate \c picker instances you
use the following line instead:
\code
#include <cgv/base/register.h>
cgv::base::factory_registration<picker> picker_registration("picker", "menu_text=\"new/picker\";shortcut='P'");
\endcode
This will add an entry into the "new" submenu of the main menu and
allow you to create \c pickers with the <Ctrl-P> shortcut. If you want to allow
only the creation of one instance of picker, the following line is your choice:
\code
#include <cgv/base/register.h>
cgv::base::factory_registration<picker> picker_registration("picker", "menu_text=\"new/picker\";shortcut='P'", true);
\endcode
In this signleton case pressing the shortcut <Ctrl-P> several times hides and shows your 
picker instance.

Finally, to add your own registration listener you use the object_registration helper
class on a class derived by cgv::base::base and cgv::base::registration_listener.

\section commSEC Communication with Signals and Actions

There are two main communication helpers in the cgv framework: signals 
and actions. A signal is a callback manager that can be used like a 
function. It has a signature and can be called like a function. It manages
a list of callbacks to which functions, methods and instances with ()-operator
can be added. An action on the other hand tells how to call the method
of a given class. It stores the arguments that are passed to the method.
An action is typically passed to a traversal algorithm or class that 
traverses a tree or acyclic graph built out of cgv::base::group instances.
On every instance it checks whether it has the type needed to call the
method of the action and if yes calls this method with the arguments stored
in the action.

Signals are often used in the gui framework to notify of events such as
value change events or button press events. Actions are typically applied
to a scene graph or the tree of drawables in the 3d view of the cgv_viewer, 
for example to init or draw the drawables or pass events to the drawables.

\subsection sigTut Tutorial on the Usage of Signals

We start with a very simple example of using a signal that takes a single
integer parameter. One declares the signal according to 
\code
#include <iostream>
#include <cgv/base/signal.h>

signal<int> int_sig;
\endcode
Next we want to attach callbacks to the signal, where in the simplest version
the functions, methods or functors have the same signature (same number and type
of parameters). Let us declare the following function and class type
\code
void int_func(int i) { std::cout << "f(" << i << ")" << std::endl; }

class X : public cgv::base::tacker
{
public:
	void int_method(int i)   { std::cout << "X::m(" << i << ")" << std::endl; }
	void operator () (int i) { std::cout << "X(" << i << ")" << std::endl; }
};

X x;
\endcode
Now we have a function and a method that take one integer argument exactly like the signal.
Instances of class \c X like \c x in our example also have the ()-operator overloaded
with one integer argument. Thus these instances are at the same time functors and can 
be used as a function with one integer argument, i.e. \c x(17).

Note that the class \c X is derived from cgv::base::tacker, which is important to avoid
invalid pointers as explained below.

Next we want to attach our three different callbacks to the signal:
\code
connect(int_sig, int_func);
connect(int_sig, &x, &X::int_method);
connect(int_sig, x);
\endcode
Note that when attaching a method of an instance to a signal, one has to provide
the this pointer of the instance and the method pointer, which is specified in C++
with a leading &-symbol followed by the class name, two colons and the method name.

After the attachment of callbacks we can send out a signal what can be interpreted
as emitting an event. This is done by using the signal in exactly the same way as a
function with an integer argument:
\code
int_sig(13);
\endcode
what generates the following output to the std::cout stream
\code
f(13)
X::m(13)
X(13)
\endcode

Similar to the attachment of callbacks with the cgv::base::connect function, one can
detach a callback with cgv::base::disconnect according to
\code
disconnect(int_sig, int_func);
disconnect(int_sig, &x, &X::int_method);
disconnect(int_sig, x);
\endcode
Note that when disconnecting a functor instance, all methods of the same instance 
attached to the signal as callback are detached as well.

Callbacks to methods of instances or functors bear the danger that the instance
to which the signal was connected is destructed before the signal is emitted. In
this case the signal would call a method or the ()-operator with an invalid this
pointer. 

To avoid this problem, all class that can be attached with a method or as functor
to a signal, have to be derived from the cgv::base::tacker class, which registers
all connections of the class instance to any signals and removes these connections 
on destruction of the instance. When a signal is then emitted it wont do a callback
with invalid this pointer as the tacker class removed the callback from the signal.

Here a short example that relies on this functionality:
\code
{
   X x1;
   connect(int_sig, x1);
}
int_sig(11);
\endcode
Signals with more than one argument work in exactly the same way. More difficult
is the support for return values as these have to be combined from the return
values of the different callbacks. The only return values supported in the cgv
framework are of type bool. For boolean return values one can use logical operators
to combine the return values of the callbacks. In the framework logical AND and OR 
are supported. One can further select between short circuit evaluation and full
evaluation. The short circuit evaluation stopps performing callbacks as soon as
the final return value cannot change anymore, i.e. as soon as the first callback
returns false when logical AND is used for combining.

The support for signals with boolean return values is provided by the 
cgv::base::bool_signal template. The logical operator and whether short circuit
evaluation should be used is specified as string argument in the constructor of 
the signal. The default choise is logical AND in the short circuit version. It 
follows a code example, where a boolean signal is used to check the validity of
a value with the full boolean AND combining option.
\code
bool_signal<int> check_valid("+&"); // use '+'/'*' for full/short circuit eval
                                    // and '&'/'|' for logical AND/OR combination
bool up_check(int i)   { return i < 10; } 
bool down_check(int i) { return i > 3; }

connect(check_valid, up_check);
connect(check_valid, down_check);

if (check_valid(7))
	std::cout << "7 is valid" << std::endl;
\endcode

The final feature supported in the signal mechanism of cgv is argument rebinding
of the callbacks. Suppose you have a callback that has a different number or 
different types of arguments as the signal to which you want to attach the callback.
This would typically require the implementation of an interface function with a
signature matching that of the signal and an implementation that calls the callback
with parameters derived from the parameters retrieved from the signal.

In cases where this conversion of parameters is simply the exclusion of one or several
parameters, a rearrangement or the addition of a constant or reference to a variable, 
one can use the functions cgv::gui::rebind to generate a functor implementing the 
parameter conversion without the need for the declaration of a new function.

The functors returned by cgv::base::rebind overload the ()-operator with all 
possible signatures such that they can be attached to any signal. Currently,
rebinding is only supported for function and methods and not for functors.
In case of a function the first parameter to the rebind function is the function 
itself. In case of a method the first two 
parameters are the this pointer and the method pointer. Depending on the number of
arguments in the signature of the rebound function / method, the rebind() functions 
takes one further parameter for each function / method argument. This argument can
be one out of
- cgv::base::_0, _1, ..., _9 ... to specify the i-th parameter from the signal
- cgv::base::_c(value)       ... to specify a constant value
- cgv::base::_r(variable)    ... to specify a reference to a variable

Here are some examples for rebinding with respect to the integer signal used in 
the examples before.
\code
// ignore parameter from signal when calling a procedure without parameters 
rebind(proc,    int_sig);

// use constant string value for first argument and first parameter from
// signal for second parameter when calling a method from an instance y
// of type Y that takes a string and an int as parameters.
rebind(y, &Y::str_int_method, int_sig, _c(std::string("string argument")), _0);
\endcode

The rebind function finally returns a functor instance that could be attached to
an arbitrary signal. As the returned functor is a temporary object, it would be 
destroyed after the connect function call has been evaluated. To avoid this, one 
uses the cgv::base::connect_copy() function instead of the cgv::base::connect() 
function when attaching a functor resulting from the cgv::base::rebind() function 
to the signals. This will cause the creation of a permanent copy of the functor.

One final pitfall should be mentioned: when rebinding to a
method \c m() which is implemented in a base class \c B of the class \c A, the
this pointer of type \c A has to be cast to the base type \c B when used in the
rebind method, i.e. 
\code
class B {
   void m(int i);
};
class A : public B {
};

A a;

connect_copy(int_sig, rebind(static_cast<B*>(&a), &B::m)
\endcode
Thus you need to use type \c B to cast the this pointer as well as for specifying the
method pointer.

Finally, one must note that the error messages generated by the compiler, when using
signals are especially unreadable in case of wrong usage of the rebind functions. Please
check your code against the explanation here to try to eliminate the error and dont
try to understand the error message - or rather huge number of error messages.
